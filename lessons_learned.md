### Working with Python dictionaries
When working with dictionaries in Python, just access them this way:
```python
>>> catalog: dict = {'name': "Mouse", 'price': 200}
>>> catalog['name'] # this is best method, it works all the time
Mouse
>>> catalog.name # this does not work all the time, it is selective; haven't figured out why
Mouse
```

### Headers are added by default to any request sent using the requests library
Requests from the requests lib by default will send the ```Content-Type``` in the
request header, so one should not add it to their custom headers. [credits](https://stackoverflow.com/a/73383831)
